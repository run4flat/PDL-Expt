PDL-Expt

The Perl Data Language - PDL for short - is a powerful extension to
Perl that provides optimized, vectorized mathematics akin to those
available in Matlab or IDL. PDL::Expt is the Perl Data Language's
Experimental Sandbox.

Sometimes those of us who use PDL come up with handy functions or
scripts. They are too small to warrant their own CPAN distribution
and not yet polished enough to warrant being added into PDL's base
distribution. PDL::Expt is a place for just these sorts of ideas,
and any other experimental work with PDL. It is both a route for
new modules into the base distribution and a final resting place
many small modules whose authors just want to get their ideas
'out there.'

All code submitted to PDL::Expt is placed in an author-specific
subdirectory (not unlike CPAN). For example, contributions from
David Mertens can be found in PDL::Expt::dcmertens. For more
information, see the documentation for PDL::Expt.
